In the decision tree (tree_sample.png), we focus on the unexpected behaviors related to 'tol' parameter. Starting from the root, the left branch reflects samples that are not using solver=='saga' (the right part is for solver=='saga' that corresponds to Figure 1 (b)). Taking the left branch further, we see the node where 'tol' <= 0.0 is tested and if it is not true (meaning tol > 0.0), then it visits a leaf node with the majority samples in the first class (this is black cluster). If 'tol' == 0, we visit the left branch further and visit the node with solver == 'neton-cg'. Here we see two leaf nodes: one in the left side with the majority samples in the first class (black cluster) and another one in the right side with the majority samples in the fourth class (blue cluster).
We simplify this decision tree for illustration in the paper.
